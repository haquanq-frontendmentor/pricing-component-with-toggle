## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello everyone :moyai:

Learned to build an accessible switch button following accessiblity guidelines from [W3 Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns).

:seedling: **Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- ARIA specifications
- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

:memo: **What i have done**

- Created switch button from radio inputs with accessibility.
- Made the solution as close to the design as possible (i don't have Figma files).
- Added custom effects on interactive elements (on focus/active/hover).

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

The challenge was there, but i overcame it anyway.

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

Would love to hear your opinions on any topic.
